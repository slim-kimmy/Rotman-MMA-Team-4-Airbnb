Generate a JSON array of 50 unique vacation rental listings.  
Each listing should have the following fields:  
- property_id: sequential starting at 900  
- location: randomly chosen from ["Montreal Old Town", "Toronto Downtown", "Vancouver Waterfront", "Banff Village", "Quebec City", "Whistler Mountain", "Ottawa Riverside", "Halifax Harbour", "Victoria Gardens", "Niagara Falls"]  
- type: randomly chosen from ["bungalow", "condo", "apartment", "chalet", "villa", "loft", "townhouse", "cabin"]  
- price_per_night: realistic value for location/type (bungalows ~75–160, condos/apartments/lofts ~100–180, townhouses/cabins/chalets ~140–230, villas ~200–300)  
- capacity: integer for how many people can stay, realistic for the property type (bungalows 2–4, condos/apartments/lofts 2–5, townhouses 4–6, cabins/chalets 2–6, villas 4–10)  
- features: random 3–5 elements from ["ski-in", "washer", "parking", "balcony", "fireplace", "pool", "garden", "wifi", "sauna", "pet-friendly"]  
- tags: random 3–5 elements from ["nature", "nightlife", "summer escape", "historic", "romantic", "family-friendly", "luxury", "budget", "adventure", "secluded"]  
- description: 1–3 sentences written in the style of a property owner speaking directly to a guest, with a variety of tones (warm, poetic, casual, blunt, quirky). Avoid repetitive phrasing.

Requirements:
- No two descriptions should sound the same.  
- Shuffle all attributes so the dataset feels organic and not templated.  
- Output ONLY valid JSON without comments or extra text.  
- Ensure proper JSON syntax (commas, brackets, quotes) so it can be parsed directly.
